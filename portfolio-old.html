                        <h4>VR Glasses Using Perspective Parallax</h4>
                        <p>In this project, a single conventional monitor and a combination of modified and custom hardware was used to make a simple VR demo, where the user could "look through" the monitor like a portal into the virtual space. The method used is a combination of two commonly used technologies, 3D shutter glasses, and object tracking. By using object tracking, we could allow the user to look around the scene in front of them by moving their head around. The shutter glasses allowed for a sense of depth in the scene. </p>

                        <h4>Tic-Tac-Toe AI From First Principles</h4>
                        <p>In this project, we aimed to create a tic-tac-toe AI that could work for any size of board. The main challenge was designing an algorithm that was performant for all sizes, as when the board size increases, the number of possible moves (hence the number of situations the AI has to check) increases exponentially. We devised an algorithm that could account for this, and built it from the ground up using mathematics based AI principles wherever possible.</p>

                        <p>iSpi is a stealth, horror, and espionage game. In this game you play as a Spy who works for a secret organization that sends you on missions to acquire intel for them. iSpi puts a twist on your general stealth game with a dimension shift mechanic that puts you in the "Upside-Down", a corrupted version of the the normal reality that must be used to traverse the levels.</p>
                        <p>This game was made over the course of 2 days for the DevLUP Wargames 2023 Game Jam, and won 2nd overall in Gameplay <a href="https://itch.io/jam/devlup-fall-23-wargames/entries" style="color: #0066CC;">(View All Entries Here)</a></p>
                        <p>My responsibilites on this game were coding basic game mechanics, 2D art/UI, sound/music design, and level design</p>
                        <p>Also since we ran out of time, we couldn't include the tutorial level I made :(. Controls are WASD, use the scroll wheel to select hotbar items, click to use the item. E to open doors.</p>

                        <h2>Interactive Pumpkin Competition</h2>
                        <p>In this project, I entered a pumpkin carving competition, where the goal was to add circuitry/sensors to add entertainment value to the end product. My submission was a pumpkin which would only activate at night, then wait for someone to cross its eyeline, before scaring them away. Some of the main issues seen here were cooling, as well as portability.</p>
                        <p>I not only won first place, but even better, I scored extra credit!</p>

                        <p>This project aims to develop a system that allows a collaborative robot (COBOT) to play chess with humans seamlessly and safely. The system integrates various components, including the COBOT (a modified AR3 robot arm from Annin Robotics), the Robot Operating System (ROS2), computer vision (using an Xbox Kinect and integrated ArduCam depth cameras), a custom chess clock, and a web-based dashboard. The COBOT is designed to interact with humans during a game of chess while considering human factors to ensure predictable and safe behavior.</p>
